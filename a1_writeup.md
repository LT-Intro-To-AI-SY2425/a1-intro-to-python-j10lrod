# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?

I think that, while very similar to Java, is much more complex in my opinion, in terms of terminology/actual code language. But in terms of strcture, it seems simpler than Java.

2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?

Python, at an introductory level, is very similar to both Java and C#. Many of the structural elements of each language are very similar, but each have terminology differences.

3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?

I learned how to find mean, median, and range through Python. I also learned some of the basic structural elements of introductory Python, such as lists, for loops, etc.
